1. Facebook vs TikTok, is there purposeful exclusion? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business?
- TikTok makes a for you page and bases it off of what you like, can be exclusive/biased
- Facebook does a similar thing as TikTok


2. Amazon, Alexa Google, Apple Siri original had flaws in detecting accents or young voices, was this purposeful? Is it harmful? Should it be corrected? Is it good business?
- It was not purposeful, but its harmful
- It should be corrected because it is excluding people who may not speak the language fluently

3. Netflix, do their algorithm purposely bias certain content to certain watchers? Is it harmful? Is it good business?
- It is good business, as it tailors to the users desires
- It should function a little differently than social media

1. Come up with some thoughts on the video and be ready to discuss them as I call on you. Here are some ideas...

Does the owner of the computer think this was intentional?
- I do not think its intentional

If yes or no, justify you conclusion.
- They probably thought they didn't need to ensure it worked with different skin tones, and assumed it worked for all since it worked on lighter skin tones

How do you think this happened?
- Poor testing and design

Is this harmful? Was it intended to be harmful or exclude?
- It is harmful because users with darker skin are not able to use this feature, and may feel discriminated against and excluded

Should it be corrected?
- It should be corrected as soon as possible

What would you or should you do to produce a better outcome?
- Before releasing a feature such as this, test it on different face shapes, sizes, and colors.
